            <h4>About me</h4>
            <p>
                I was raised in Chicago (go Blackhawks!) and now attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I’m working towards a B.S. in Computer Science and minors in Data Science and Hispanic Studies.
            </p>
            <p>
                I currently work as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for COMP 110 - Introduction to Programming and Data Science. As a UTA, I offer one-on-one support to over 800 students, as well as grading and curriculum assistance to our professor’s team of 30 UTA’s.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also serve as Vice President of Kappa Theta Pi, a technology-oriented pre-professional fraternity, and am a member of Women in CS!
            </p>
            <p>
                My professional interests include software development, human-computing interaction, Spanish, and the study of the American south.

                My personal interests include sailing, reading, spending time outdoors, hockey, and anything related to Chicago or the Tar Heels!
